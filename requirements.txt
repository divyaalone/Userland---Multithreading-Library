Implement a multithreading library

Implement a user level multithreading library. Since it's Linux systems, the library should come with options to do one-one,  many-one or many-many scheudling (any 2 of the three) of user threads on kernel threads. It should support following functions:
thread_create() ; // provide option to use a desired mapping.
thread_join()
thread_exit()
thread_lock(); // a spinlock
thread_unlock();  // spin-unlock
thread_kill();

Note: you need to use the SIGALRM signals to do scheduling. Learn setjmp and longjmp in C library, you may also use the ucontext library.

Each of the two library implementations: 13 marks each. ,

Automated Testing code: 10 marks

synchronization: 8 marks

signal handling: 6 marks
